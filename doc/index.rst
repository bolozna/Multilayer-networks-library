Welcome to Multilayer Networks Library's documentation!
=======================================================

This the documentation for the Multilayer Networks Library. The library provides scalable data structures for general multilayer networks, and basic methods for analysing such networks. The libarary is based on the mathematical definition of a general multilayer network presented in a `review article <http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7233>`_ which was used to represent various types of multilayer networks found in the literature. It can handle, for example, multiplex networks and interdependent networks. Further, it can handle multiplex networks with multiple aspects, for example when the edges have multiple types and are changing in time.


The library is free and available for download directly from our `repository <http://bitbucket.org/bolozna/multilayer-networks-library>`_.
